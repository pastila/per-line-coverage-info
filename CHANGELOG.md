# per-line-coverage-info Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- A pinned coverage artifact (chosen in Artifacts or imported from a local .covt file) is no longer replaced by the 30-second refresh or by automatic retries; "Load Coverage from GitLab" and "Fetch" lift the pin and load the current commit
- "Clear Coverage Data" now stays cleared: it stops the refresh timer and lifts the pin; coverage comes back on the next commit change, a settings change or a manual load
- A coverage answer that arrives after you switched commits is shown as outdated and the coverage of the new commit is loaded right away, instead of being presented as up to date
- Fewer rare glitches with simultaneous loads and editor repaints: the coverage state is now updated atomically
- Bundle the covd daemon for all five platforms in the plugin zip: earlier release builds shipped without it and could not load any coverage ("daemon unavailable"); the build now fails when a binary is missing
- Keep an updated plugin from running the daemon binary that an older version extracted: the binary is extracted to a directory named after its content, through an atomic move, so a half-written file is never used
- Retry a coverage load that fails on a transient daemon or GitLab error three times (5 s / 15 s / 45 s, never sooner than the daemon asks) and then show a "Coverage Notifications" balloon with *Retry now* and *Show log*; a new balloon replaces the old one
- Stop retrying an expired or invalid GitLab token: a sticky balloon offers *Update token…*, the 30 s poller and the HEAD tracker stay quiet until the token, the domain or the HEAD changes, and applying the settings loads again without an IDE restart
- Stop asking GitLab every 30 seconds for a deterministic failure (`NO_COMPONENT_JOBS`, `NO_DATA`, `PROJECT_SETUP`, `GIT`): the poller waits for a new HEAD or changed settings, and a manual *Load Coverage from GitLab* always bypasses the block
- Add test/diagnostics knobs `-Dcoverage.retry.delaysMs=500,1500,4500` and `-Dcoverage.uiTestCommands=<file>`; the UI-test snapshot reports `retryAttempt`, `retryMax`, `blocked`, `notifications` and `lastCommand`
- Add real-project diagnostics: `-Dcoverage.cacheRoot` and `-Dcoverage.perf.dir` relocate the covd cache and the perf log, `-Dcoverage.covdResponses=<dir>` saves every `ensure`/`import` answer (never the token), the daemon trace now keeps its GitLab calls and errors, the perf log gains `covd.response`/`covd.spawn`/`ev=covdsample` (pid, RSS, CPU, threads, VSZ of the daemon), and the UI-test snapshot reports `loading`, `coverageGeneration`, `dumb`, `covdInstanceId` and `covdPid`
- Start the covd daemon once when several coverage requests arrive together (a cold client used to spawn one process per caller), and restart it once, not once per caller, after it exits
- Handle daemon answers by HTTP status: an error without a `state` (for example an expired daemon token) is reported as an error instead of an empty state, and a non-JSON reply from a proxy is reported as "daemon unavailable" instead of failing with a parser exception
- Accept an explicit scheme in the GitLab domain setting (`http://host:8080`) for GitLab instances without TLS; a bare domain still means `https://`
- Fix the GitLab project list in Settings → Tools → GitLab Coverage: project paths were always empty (snake_case fields were not mapped), so rows were blank and search by path found nothing
- Retry the project list request on timeouts and `5xx` answers (3 attempts with a pause) and show the real failure reason in the dialog instead of an empty list
- Load coverage through the covd daemon: pipeline resolution, artifact download and COV4 building happen outside the IDE process and are shared by all IDE windows; the daemon is required, the plugin no longer downloads or parses artifacts itself
- Import local `.covt`/`.covt.gz` files through the daemon, so the plugin no longer carries a COVT parser, shard merger or COV4 writer
- Reduce memory and CPU overhead when processing coverage artifacts: decode shared test sets once and normalize each unique test name once per report
- Reuse the decoded test set when reading cached COV4 data, so opening a file no longer allocates one test list per covered line
- Add structured performance logging (heap, per-thread allocations, CPU, GC per phase) with a Find Action to reveal the log folder; disable with `-Dcoverage.perf.log=false`
- Reuse a cached master (baseline) coverage artifact when the current pipeline has no jobs for the component, instead of re-downloading and rewriting it on every refresh
- Speed up large coverage loads: merge shards in one pass, write COV4 sets as int arrays, and open the cache index without reading the whole file

## [2.7.2] - 2026-11-05
- Fix raketa coverage paths after the `core` → `app/raketa` move: strip the new `app/raketa/web/` CI prefix (legacy `core/web/` still supported)
- Restore the `features/` segment in raketa behat test paths so test navigation and run work again
- Update the bundled PHP coverage extension to the v2 repo-relative contract (`perLine.repoRoot`)
- Normalize old `.cov4` caches on read (paths and test names), so existing coverage keeps working after the format change without re-downloading artifacts
- Remove the `<until-build>` cap so the plugin stays installable on future IDE versions (required for `since-build` 243+)

## [2.7.1] - 2026-10-02
- Fix coverage download after the CI refactor: use the dedicated `test:behat:coverage:<component>` jobs (coverage-test stage) instead of the legacy `test:behat:<component>` jobs, which no longer publish a coverage archive
- Only jobs with a real archive artifact are treated as coverage jobs (behat jobs always have trace/junit artifacts, which previously masked the missing coverage report)

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-17
- Shared app-level GitLab coordinator: single worker thread, TTL-cached metadata and a rate limiter — dramatically fewer API requests
- Pipeline resolution memoized per repository/HEAD; refresh skipped within a 60s cooldown (zero requests on branch switches with cached coverage)
- Identical artifact downloads coalesced across project windows
- Pipeline polling interval reduced from 5s to 30s; polls share the cached API so N windows cost one network request
- `Cov4Reader` instances shared across windows (large files read once per commit)
- Disk cache writes synchronized for safety with multiple windows
- Retry HTTP 429 honouring `Retry-After`
- Send plugin name and version as `User-Agent` so requests are identifiable in GitLab server logs
- Visibility logging: cache hits/misses, rate-limiter waits, cross-window coalescing

## [2.6.0] - 2026-07-10
- Component-based coverage: separate `.cov4` per component, keyed by commit+component
- Component config with 10 components (api/avia, raketa, api/hotels, api/transfer, api/rail, api/profile-sync, api/queue, api/aeroexpress, api/contract, api/bus)
- Filter CI jobs by detected component; wait for running behat jobs (infinite, cancel via progress or branch switch)
- Fallback to baseline (master) pipeline when current branch has no jobs for the component
- Branch name stored per artifact; shown in Artifacts table
- Cache cleanup runs on every `writeCov4`; entries expire by `lastUsedMs` instead of `timestampMs`
- Reuse preloaded baseline reader to avoid redundant `.cov4` opens
- Skip initial HEAD reload in `CoverageHeadTracker` (avoids duplicate load at startup)
- Auto-refresh Artifacts panel on coverage change via `COVERAGE_CHANGED_TOPIC`
- `pluginUntilBuild` extended to `299.*`
- Simplify CI: build + release only, no tests/Qodana/Verifier/Marketplace
- Auto-create GitHub release with `.zip` asset on push to main (if version changed)

- MCP: `get_coverage_for_file` now returns per-line content with pagination (`offset`/`limit`) and `coverage` filter
- MCP: `list_files` gains `coverage` filter (`all`/`uncovered`/`fully_covered`)

- Simplify loading pipeline: unified download flow, removed dead code (`refreshBaselineFromCache`, `applyCoverageFromReader`)
- Fix double-close of `Cov4Reader` in post-download apply path
